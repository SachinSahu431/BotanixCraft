# SpiderCraft — On-Chain Game Development on Spiderchain

### Vision: 
***To revolutionize the gaming industry by enabling easy game deployment on Spiderchain.***

At present, the blockchain gaming sector remains relatively undervalued. Many of the games within this domain fall short when compared to their traditional web2 counterparts. This discrepancy largely stems from the lack of a robust ecosystem and user-friendly tools tailored specifically for designing and developing blockchain games. As a result, developers are often deterred from delving into this space. 

What's needed is a comprehensive gaming toolchain akin to established game engines such as Unity and Unreal. Such a toolchain would streamline the development process for creating web3 games, making it more accessible and appealing to developers.

SpiderCraft revolutionizes gaming industry by enabling easy game deployment. Join us in reshaping the future of gaming powered by Spiderchain.

### What is SpiderCraft?

SpiderCraft aims to revolutionize the blockchain gaming industry by offering a simple, no-code solution for designing, building, and developing games on the Spiderchain. Our solution provides developers with a natural way to upload and manage their audio, video, and 3D model assets, which can be used across their projects. 

One standout feature that makes SpiderCraft appealing to developers is its interface, seamlessly integrating in-game activities and quests with purchase features for monetizing the game through in-game purchases and selling games to users. 

Developers have granular control over the actions in the game and corresponding smart contract features, providing a transparent setting for them to make investments. From the gamer’s perspective, they have complete ownership of their game copy with NFTs, high-performance, and low gas-cost.
